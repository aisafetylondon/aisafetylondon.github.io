Talk topics will cover AI safety, AI aligment, AI cybersecurity, policy making, and how AI is being used at scale, in ways that is important for the knowledge of practitioners of all the previous disciplines.

Our group wants to be a bridge between all these professionals, engineers, researchers and students that are pushing forward AI so we can do it in a safe way. The group is open to discuss about our objectives, which will be presented this day, but discussion should continue online.

You are welcome to join even if you are not close by London, as we plan to do several activities and talks remotely.
