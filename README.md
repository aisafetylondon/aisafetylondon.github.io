You are welcome to join even if you are not close by London, as we plan to do several activities and talks remotely.

## Goals

The goal of this group is to bring together AI safety researchers, cybersecurity specialists, engineers deploying AI at scale, and policy makers, so we can exchange information and tap into each other area of expertise to guarantee that in the future, when AI is used, it is in a secure, safe, fair and ethical way.

## Activities

We plan to do some (or all) of the following:
* In-person activities as well as online/virtual
* Talks
* Hackathons
* Paper group reading
* Recent news analysis
* Give / receive recommendations for people looking to start a research project
* Give / receive support on engineers helping researchers and the other way around
* Give / receive support for policy makers understanding latest AI safety advances
* Newsletter

## What we need

In order of importance, things we need:
- The first resource we look for is people wanting to band together with us and lead or participate in our activities.
- Second is places in London to gather together and execute activities in-person.
- Technology sponsors that can contribute cloud compute or inference credits for those doing research projects, would be nice to have.
- Other kind of sponsors.
